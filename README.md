# Haemorrhage Identification
This is a personal project to try and use the knowledge that I have gained over the last year to try and identify haemorrhages with tensorflow, using a traditional architecture and then progress to using a CNN and once I become more confident with my methodology/pipeline use a larger and more complex dataset.
